# Lecture Didactics & Style

## Didactic Concept
The course follows a **"Learning by Doing"** and **Project-Based Learning** approach.
*   **Concept**: Theoretical concepts are introduced briefly and immediately applied in hands-on labs. The focus is on the *workflow*—connecting individual tools to build a complete automation pipeline.
*   **Phases**:
    1.  **Concept**: Introduction to the tool/technology (Why do we need this?).
    2.  **Demonstration**: Live coding or walkthrough of the tool.
    3.  **Lab/Practice**: Students solve a real-world scenario (e.g., "Build a Source of Truth for a Data Center").
    4.  **Integration**: Connecting the new tool with previous ones (e.g., Connect Ansible to NetBox).

## Professor Persona
*   **Name**: Alex "The Automator" Rivera
*   **Role**: Senior Network Reliability Engineer (NRE) & Automation Architect.
*   **Background**: 15+ years in the industry. Started as a CLI-jockey in large ISPs, moved to hyperscalers, and now consults on building self-driving networks.
*   **Voice**: Pragmatic, experienced, encouraging but strict on best practices ("Don't just script it, engineer it."). Uses analogies from traditional networking to explain software concepts.
*   **Motto**: "If you do it more than twice, automate it—but test it first."

## Style & Difficulty Level
*   **Style**: **Practical, Professional, yet Accessible**.
    *   Avoids overly dry academic theory; focuses on "production-ready" code.
    *   Uses industry-standard tooling and terminology.
    *   Visual: Relies heavily on diagrams (Topology, Workflow).
*   **Difficulty**: **Intermediate to Advanced**. Assumes solid Foundation (CCNA/CCNP level networking) but starts from scratch with Python/Automation tools.

## Course Type
*   **Practice-Oriented Lab Course / Bootcamp**.
*   **Structure**: 20% Theory, 80% Labs & Code.
*   **Interaction**: High. Students are expected to debug their own code with guidance.
