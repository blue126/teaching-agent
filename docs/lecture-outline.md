# Lecture Outline

## Title
Python Network Automation Bootcamp

## Target Audience
Network Engineers and IT professionals looking to master network automation, workflows, and tools.

## Time Commitment
Approx. 40-50 hours (Intensive Bootcamp or Semester Course equivalent)

## Abstract
This Bootcamp is carefully designed to guide students through the essential technologies, workflows, and tools required for successful network automation. Emphasizing a "learn by doing" approach, the course provides maximum hands-on experience with labs based on real-world scenarios. It covers the entire automation ecosystem including Source of Truth (NetBox), APIs (REST, GraphQL), Network Testing (pyATS, Batfish), Config Generation (Jinja2), and CI/CD pipelines.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Model and Validate**: Learn to model network data using NetBox as a Source of Truth and validate configurations using JSON Schema.
2. **Automate & Test**: Master deployment automation using Ansible and perform pre/post-change testing with pyATS, Batfish, and Pytest.
3. **Version Control**: Implement Git and GitHub for collaborative configuration management and version control.
4. **CI/CD Workflows**: Design and implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate network operations.
5. **API Integration**: Gain proficiency in programmatic interaction with network devices and tools using RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
