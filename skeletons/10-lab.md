# Session 10 – Git & Version Control (Lab)

## Summary
If it's not in Git, it didn't happen. Version Control is the core of "Infrastructure as Code". It gives us a history of every change, the ability to collaborate without overwriting each other, and a safety mechanism to roll back when things break. In this session, we master the Git command line and the GitHub workflow (Pull Requests).

## Content
*   **Git Concepts**: Repository, Commit, Branch, Merge, Remote.
*   **The Workflow**:
    1.  **Branch**: Create a safe space for your change (`feature/new-site`).
    2.  **Commit**: Save your work locally.
    3.  **Push**: Upload to GitHub.
    4.  **Pull Request (PR)**: Ask for a review.
    5.  **Merge**: Apply the change to `main`.
*   **Collaboration**: Handling Merge Conflicts.
*   **Git Blame**: Finding out who broke the network (it was probably you).

## Activities
*   **Lab 10.1**: Initializing a repo and pushing your scripts/playbooks to GitHub.
*   **Lab 10.2**: The "Feature Branch" workflow. Create a branch, add a new script, push it.
*   **Lab 10.3**: Collaboration Simulation. Create a Pull Request, review it (act as a peer), and merge it.
*   **Lab 10.4**: Conflict Resolution. Simulate two engineers editing the same file and fix the mess.
