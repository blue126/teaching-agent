# Session 2 – NetBox as Source of Truth (Lab)

## Summary
In this lab, we build the foundation of our automation: The Source of Truth (SoT). We will use NetBox to model a Data Center. We will stop using spreadsheets and start using a relational database that enforces integrity. We will model Sites, Racks, Device Types, and IPAM.

## Content
*   **NetBox Overview**: Dashboard, Organization, and key concepts.
*   **Organizational Modeling**: Regions, Sites, Locations.
*   **Physical Infrastructure**: Racks, Device Types (Templates), and Hardware.
*   **IPAM (IP Address Management)**: Prefixes, Aggregates, IP Addresses, and VRFs.
*   **Connectivity**: Cables, Patch Panels, and Interfaces.
*   **Virtualization**: Clusters and VMs (briefly).

## Activities
*   **Lab 2.1**: Set up your "NYC-Datacenter" Site.
*   **Lab 2.2**: Create Manufacturer (Cisco) and Device Types (Nexus 9000, CSR1000v).
*   **Lab 2.3**: Install Devices into Racks (Rack Elevation).
*   **Lab 2.4**: Define the IP Addressing Schema (IPAM) for Mgmt and Production.
